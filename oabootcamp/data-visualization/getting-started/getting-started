# Oracle Analytics – Data Visualization

**Oracle Analytics – Data Visualization** is a modern tool for visual data analysis that allows users to easily explore, understand, and present insights from data. As part of the Oracle Analytics Cloud platform, it is designed for business users who want to independently create reports, analyses, and visualizations without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

Users can import data from various sources—such as spreadsheets, relational databases, or cloud applications—and analyze it using a drag-and-drop interface. A wide range of visualizations is available, including bar and line charts, maps, KPI indicators, and heatmaps. The tool also includes support for geo-visualization, enabling the display of data on geographic layers, as well as advanced analytics functions like calculations, hierarchies, and predictive models.

A key feature of Data Visualization is the use of artificial intelligence, which automatically suggests important insights such as correlations, market trends, or unusual deviations. Visualizations can be easily shared with other users, embedded into dashboards, or integrated into other applications. In addition, the tool is optimized for use on mobile devices, allowing access to analyses anytime and anywhere.

**Oracle Analytics – Data Visualization** is an effective tool for quickly and clearly gaining insights from data, aimed at anyone looking to make better-informed business decisions.
