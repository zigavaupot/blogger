Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) is now frequently updated on bi-monthly basis. May Update release has been announced a week or so ago, and I was able to take a look at preview version which brings again several nice new [features and functionalities](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/analytics-cloud/acswn/index.html#ACSWN-GUID-CFF90F44-BCEB-49EE-B40B-8D040F02D476).

The one that draw attention to me was **Maps Conditional Formatting**, an option to highlight important data events in map visualizations along with other visualization types.

So how does this work? Actually, it is very straight forward as the same model is used as with any other conditional formatting.

The map above is the starting point and presents profitability by country. Couldn't be more simple, right?

In order to implement conditional formatting on the map, click on the traffic light icon (*Manage Conditional Formatting Rules*). This will open **Conditional Formatting** popup window.

Select to what this particular conditional formatting applies to, the whole workbook or just selected visualization. Provide a name for the rule and choose a measure. *Profit Ratio %* in this case. And then specify the bands and limits for the selected coloring.

Voila, map is instantly conditionally formatted. Very easy, very efficient.
