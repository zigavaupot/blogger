<p>Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) is now updated frequently on a bi-monthly basis, continuously adding valuable features that enhance user experience and analytical capabilities. The recent May Update, announced just a week ago, introduces several exciting new <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/analytics-cloud/acswn/index.html#ACSWN-GUID-CFF90F44-BCEB-49EE-B40B-8D040F02D476">features and functionalities</a>.</p>
<p>One feature that caught my attention is <strong>Maps Conditional Formatting</strong>—a powerful option that allows you to highlight key data points directly within map visualizations, just as you can with other chart types.</p>
<p>So, how does it work? It’s actually very straightforward, using the same conditional formatting model familiar to users from other visualization types.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/conditional-map-formatting-in-oracle-analytics/images/initial-map.png" alt="Initial Map" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></div>
<p>The map above is our starting point, showing profitability by country. Simple and clear, but without any conditional highlights.</p>
<p>To apply conditional formatting, click on the traffic light icon (<em>Manage Conditional Formatting Rules</em>). This opens the <strong>Conditional Formatting</strong> popup window.</p>

<p>Here, you can choose whether the formatting applies to the entire workbook or just the selected visualization. Then, name your rule, select a measure—in this case, <em>Profit Ratio %</em>—and specify the value ranges and corresponding colors.</p>
<p>With just a few clicks, your map instantly reflects the conditional formatting, making it easier to spot important trends and outliers.</p>

<p>In summary, Maps Conditional Formatting enhances your ability to communicate insights visually and effectively within Oracle Analytics Cloud. I encourage you to explore this feature in your own workbooks and see how it can bring your data stories to life.</p>
