Working with data in databases requires Oracle Analytics administrators to create connections. There are two types of connections:

- **"Regular" connections** connect Oracle Analytics to databases and allow users to retrieve data.
- **"System" connections** are used to create and maintain semantic models and metadata repositories.

In Oracle Analytics, **both connection types are required**.

# Regular Connections

I'm using the term **"regular"** here, as Oracle does not use a specific label for this type of connection. It simply refers to a connection that allows users to retrieve data and analyze it using **Data Visualization**.

Oracle Bootcamp uses the following tables:

![Database tables](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/creating-system-connection/images/tables.png?raw=true)

To create such a connection, navigate to **Data** in the **Navigator** menu in Oracle Analytics. Under the second tab, all connections are listed. In our case, the list is empty:

![Connections](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/creating-system-connection/images/connections-empty.png?raw=true)

To create a new connection, click **Create** in the top-right corner and select **Connection**:

![Create a new connection](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/creating-system-connection/images/create-connection.png?raw=true)

The **Create Connection** dialog appears. Select the database type—in our example, we are using Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse.

![Create Connection Dialog 1](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/creating-system-connection/images/create-connection-dialog-1.png?raw=true)

Once the database type is selected, the dialog proceeds to the second step: entering connection details.

![Create Connection Dialog 2](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/creating-system-connection/images/create-connection-dialog-2.png?raw=true)

Provide a meaningful connection name and description. For Autonomous Data Warehouse:

- Select *Mutual TLS* as the **Encryption Type**
- Choose the *Wallet* file downloaded from your database console
- Enter your **username** and **password**
- Select *_high* as the **Service Name**
- Leave **Authentication** set to *Always use these credentials*

Click **Save**, and the connection should be successfully created.

This connection can now be used to retrieve data from the database—for example, when creating datasets. However, it **cannot** be used in the **Semantic Modeler** to create or manage semantic models or repositories. For that, you must create a **System Connection**.

# System Connections

System Connections are required when creating or updating semantic models using the Semantic Modeler. Creating one is similar to creating a "regular" connection, with one important difference: you must explicitly declare it as a **System Connection** by checking the corresponding box in the **Create Connection** dialog.

So, we need to create another connection and, in the final step, check the **System Connection** checkbox:

![Create System Connection](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/creating-system-connection/images/create-system-connection.png?raw=true)

The connections list should now show two entries:

![Connections List](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/creating-system-connection/images/connections-list.png?raw=true)

One final note: if you're using an earlier version of Oracle Analytics, you may experience issues when connecting to a database from Semantic Modeler. In such cases, try using a shorter connection name—**8 characters or fewer** usually works best.

In our labs, we will use the **system connection**.
