![Using Git with Semantic Modeler](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/using-git-with-semantic-modeler/images/xxx.png?raw=true)

### Setting up

I will assume that I have already created a semantic model that is already deployed. My intention is to share this semantic model with other developers. In OBIEE this was only possible by setting up **Multi-User Development Environment** (MUDE). In general, Oracle Analytics gives developers two options to setup (much stronger) collaborative environment by:
*giving **permissions** to make updates to the model to other users - Semantic Modeler is, in a waz, by default multi-user development environment, and
*using **Git**, which provides proper multi-user development environment. In this case, access rights are given through Git directly.

Integrating Semantic Modeler with Git is relatively straight forward process that can be accomplished within a few steps. Each Semantic Modeler in the list of models has associated menu (accessible on the right hand side). Open a menu and select **Inspect**.

Both options for setting multi-user development environment are available under **Sharing** tab on the right:

**Permissions**

**Git**

As you can see, **Git** is preferred option, however in my case it hasn't been configured yet. To configure git integration, one must open Semantic Model and click Git icon (located in bottom-left corner).

Because we haven't configured Git, Git has to be initialized first.
