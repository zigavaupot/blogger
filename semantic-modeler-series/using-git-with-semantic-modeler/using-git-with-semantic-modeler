![Using Git with Semantic Modeler](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/using-git-with-semantic-modeler/images/xxx.png?raw=true)

### Setting up

I will assume that I have already created a semantic model that is already deployed. My intention is to share this semantic model with other developers. In OBIEE this was only possible by setting up **Multi-User Development Environment** (MUDE). In general, Oracle Analytics gives developers two options to setup (much stronger) collaborative environment by:
*giving **permissions** to make updates to the model to other users - Semantic Modeler is, in a waz, by default multi-user development environment, and
*using **Git**, which provides proper multi-user development environment. In this case, access rights are given through Git directly.

Integrating Semantic Modeler with Git is relatively straight forward process that can be accomplished within a few steps. Each Semantic Modeler in the list of models has associated menu (accessible on the right hand side). Open a menu and select **Inspect**.

Both options for setting multi-user development environment are available under **Sharing** tab on the right:

**Permissions**

**Git**

As you can see, **Git** is preferred option, however in my case it hasn't been configured yet. To configure git integration, one must open Semantic Model and click Git icon (located in bottom-left corner).

Because we haven't configured Git, Git has to be initialized first.

![Start configuring Git](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/using-git-with-semantic-modeler/images/start-configuring-git.png?raw=true)

Initialize Git window opens. It is assumed that Git repository has already been created, so Git repository URL should be provided.

Just for the further reference, here is my Git repository for this case:

As it is also shown in instructions, there are two options for providing required URL, HTTPS or SSH. In our example, the following URLs can be used:

![URL HTTPS](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/using-git-with-semantic-modeler/images/url-https.png?raw=true)

![URL SSH](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/semantic-modeler-series/using-git-with-semantic-modeler/images/url-ssh.png?raw=true)

Copy URL into *Git Repository URL* and leave *Branch Name* set to **main** (assuming this is main branch).
