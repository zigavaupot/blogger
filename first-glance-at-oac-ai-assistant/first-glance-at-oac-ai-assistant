### It’s Finally Here!

AI Assistant has been available in Oracle Analytics for a few months now, but until recently, I hadn’t been able to test or use it. Why? Because Oracle only enabled its built-in LLM in select regions and on instances with at least 10 OCPUs.

Is that a reasonable limitation? Probably. But for those of us who aren’t spending thousands of Universal Credits on our OAC instances every month, it’s also pretty frustrating. A powerful temptating feature—so close, yet still out of reach.

With the March 2025 release, this is finally changing! Oracle has enhanced the Oracle Analytics AI Assistant by adding the option to use third-party LLMs. And of course, I immediately put it to the test.

### Registering and activating custom LLM with Oracle Analytics

There are a couple of steps that users who would want to connect their custom LLMs with Oracle Analytics need to perform. Registering a custom LLM with Oracle Analytics is one of them.

**Large Language Models** is a new choice option under **Extensions and Enrichments** in **Console**

Image below shows one registered LLM model with name ChatGPT (custom name given). This LLM model is than active model used with **Assistant** feature (will there be more features in the future?). So registering and activating a custom LLM model is a two-step process:

* Register LLM

To register LLM with OAC click *Register LLM to use in Oracle Analytics Features*.

*Register LLM* is pop-up window with a form where detailed information about the model is entered. Currently, it is only possible to select **OpenAI** as a *LLM Service* and **gpt-4-turbo** as a *Model*.

Users have to provide **API Key** which can be generated and obtained from [OpenAI API Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview). 

During creation process of a **new secret key**, **API Key** is generated. Users are advised to copy it to a safe location as there's no way to obtain once process is completed.

![Create API Key](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/api-keys.png?raw=true)

Anyways, copy and paste API Key into requested field in *Register LLM* form. Before adding, API Key needs to be validated.

In my example, I can see two LLMs registered:

![Registered LLMs list](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/registered-llm-list.png?raw=true)

In the list above, we can see that model with name **ChatGPT** is active (check *Status* column) and **Feature Usage** is *Assistant*. For model named **ChatGPT-4T**, **Feature Usage** is set to *None*.

* Activate Analytics Features

Once model is registered, it has to be actived. 

![Activate LLM](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/activate-llm.png?raw=true)

New LLM has to be chosen from the LLM Name list. Selection has to be additionally confirmed by **Update**.

Newly registered model has been activated successfully:

### Let's test it!

I must admit I was caught unprepared. In order to save my credits, I have only one **OAC Professional Edition** active, which is nothing wrong, my ChatGPT will work, but I can't test how it would work with **Subject Areas**. So this is still to come (after my new OAC Enterprise Edition instance is updated with March 2025 release), but for initial tests, this will be good enough.

For my first glance at AI Assistant, I am using more or less standard *cloud_sample_data_denorm*, simple flattened sales data, dataset.

![Sample dataset](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/cloud-sample-data-denorm.png?raw=true)

Two steps are still required:

* Enable Insights 

Open **Inspect** for dataset, check **Enable Insights** checkbox under **General** tab.

![Enable insights](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/inspect-general-enable-insights.png?raw=true)

* Index Dataset

Navigate to **Search** in **Inspect** pop-up window. Set parameters that define dataset indexing.

![Search](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/inspect-search.png?raw=true)

Before using dataset with AI Assistent, dataset needs to be indexed. **Run now** will index dataset as defined. I will finish in a minute or so.
