### Itâ€™s Finally Here!

Oracle Analytics AI Assistant has been available for a few months, but until recently, I hadnâ€™t had the opportunity to test or use it. Why? Because Oracle only enabled its built-in Large Language Model (LLM) in select regions and on instances with a minimum of 10 OCPUs.

Is that a reasonable limitation? Probably. But for those of us who arenâ€™t spending thousands of Universal Credits on our Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) instances every month, itâ€™s undeniably frustrating. A powerful, tempting featureâ€”so close, yet still out of reach.

With the March 2025 release, this is finally changing! Oracle has enhanced the Oracle Analytics AI Assistant by adding the option to integrate third-party LLMs. Naturally, I jumped at the chance to put this new capability to the test.

### What is Oracle Analytics AI Assistant

Oracle Analytics AI Assistant is a built-in, AI-powered feature within **Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)** that enables users to interact with their data more intuitively using **natural language**. It leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to assist with data exploration, visualization, and insights generation.

**Key Capabilities**

- **Conversational Analytics** â€“ Ask questions in natural language and receive instant insights.  
- **Visualization Generation** â€“ Automatically creates charts and dashboards based on queries.  
- **Third-Party LLM Integration (March 2025)** â€“ Newly introduced capability to use external AI models for enhanced analysis.

This feature aims to make **self-service analytics more accessible** to both technical and non-technical users by simplifying the way they work with data.

### Registering and Activating a 3rd-Party LLM with Oracle Analytics  

To integrate a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) with Oracle Analytics, users must follow a few key steps. One of the primary steps is registering the LLM within Oracle Analytics.

A new option, **Large Language Models**, is now available under **Extensions and Enrichments** in the **Console**.

![Administration Console](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/oac-admin-console.png)

The image below shows an example of a registered LLM named **ChatGPT** (a custom name). This LLM is set as the active model used for the **Assistant** feature. Registering and activating a third-party LLM involves two steps:

---

### 1. Register the LLM  

To register an LLM with Oracle Analytics, click **Register LLM to use in Oracle Analytics Features**.

![Register LLM to use in OA Features](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/register-llm-to-use-in-oa-features.png)

A pop-up window appears with a registration form where detailed information about the model must be entered. Currently, only **OpenAI** can be selected as the *LLM Service*, and **gpt-4-turbo** is the available *Model* option.

Users must provide an **API Key**, which can be obtained from the [OpenAI API Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).

When creating a **new secret key**, the **API Key** is generated. Users should copy and securely store it, as it cannot be retrieved later.

![Create API Key](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/api-keys.png)

After obtaining the API Key, paste it into the designated field in the *Register LLM* form. The API Key must be validated before proceeding.

In this example, two LLMs have been registered:

![Registered LLMs list](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/registered-llm-list.png)

The list above shows that the **ChatGPT** model is active (*Status* column), and its **Feature Usage** is set to *Assistant*. The **ChatGPT-4T** model, however, has *None* as its **Feature Usage**, indicating it has not yet been activated.

---

### 2. Activate Analytics Features  

Once an LLM is registered, it must be activated to be used in Oracle Analytics.

![Activate LLM](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/activate-llm.png)

To activate the model, select it from the **LLM Name** list and confirm by clicking **Update**.

Once successfully activated, the newly registered model will be ready for use:

### Let's Test It!

I must admit, I was caught unprepared. To save my credits, I currently have only one **OAC Professional Edition** instance active. While this is perfectly fine and allows me to use ChatGPT, I am unable to test how it interacts with **Subject Areas**. That will have to wait until my new **OAC Enterprise Edition** instance is updated with the March 2025 release.

For my initial tests, I am using the standard **cloud_sample_data_denorm** dataset, which consists of simple, flattened sales data.

![Sample dataset](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/cloud-sample-data-denorm.png)

## Preparing the Dataset  

Before using the dataset with the AI Assistant, two additional steps are required:

### 1. Enable Insights  

Open **Inspect** for the dataset and check the **Enable Insights** checkbox under the **General** tab.

![Enable insights](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/inspect-general-enable-insights.png)

### 2. Index the Dataset  

Navigate to **Search** in the **Inspect** pop-up window and set the parameters that define dataset indexing.

![Search](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/inspect-search.png)

Before using the dataset with the AI Assistant, it must be indexed. Click **Run now** to start the indexing process, which typically completes in about a minute.

## Testing the AI Assistant  

Now that the dataset has been indexed, we are ready to create a new workbook and interact with the AI Assistant.

![Open AI Assistant](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/open-ai-assistant.png)

Click the **light bulb icon** in the top black ribbon to open the **Watchlists/Insights/Assistant** window. Navigate to the **Assistant** tab.

![Open AI Assistant](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/open-ai-assistant.png)

In the **Ask a question ...** field, users can input queries.

![Ask a question](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/ask-questions.png)

### Example Questions  

#### **1. Basic Revenue Query**  

**Question:** `What is total revenue?`  

**Response:**  

![Question 1](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-1.png)

The response seems accurate. Now, let's refine the query.

#### **2. Revenue by Month**  

**Question:** `What is revenue by month?`  

![Question 2](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-2.png)

#### **3. Revenue by Customer Segment**  

Let's take it a step further and break revenue down by customer segments.

![Question 3](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-3.png)

The AI correctly splits revenue by customer segments, but I was hoping to also include a time-based breakdown. Since my query wasnâ€™t very specific, letâ€™s refine it further.

#### **4. Revenue Breakdown by Time and Customer Segment**  

This is what I had in mind:

![Question 4](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-4.png)

Now, I can change the chart type to something more visually effective, like a *stacked area* chart.

![Question 5](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-5.png)

This results in the following visualization:

![Question 6](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-6.png)

I can now add this visualization to my analysis canvas. Hover over the visualization and click the **+** sign to add it to the canvas.

![Add to canvas](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/add-to-canvas.png)

Hereâ€™s how it looks on the canvas:

## Summary  

Registering a custom AI Assistant in Oracle Analytics works well. My initial questions were answered quickly and correctly. However, as I began testing more complex queriesâ€”especially those involving additional Oracle Analytics contentâ€”the results were less impressive.

That said, **Rome wasnâ€™t built in a day**.

Interestingly, I tested questions in **Slovenian**, and since I am using ChatGPT, it handled them wellâ€”despite the dataset being **English-only**. Thatâ€™s an encouraging sign.

### Comparing with SELECT AI  

Previously, I tested **SELECT AI** in Oracle Autonomous Database and was impressed by its ability to interpret questions based on implied measures that werenâ€™t explicitly defined in the dataset.

For example, even though **Profit Ratio** wasnâ€™t predefined, **SELECT AI** was able to calculate it. In contrast, Oracle Analytics returned the following:

![Question 7](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-7.png)

When I asked a complex question in Slovenianâ€”`What is revenue, total costs, profit, profit ratio, fixed costs share, variable costs share by product brand, customer segment, and region for this year?`â€”**SELECT AI** got it **100% correct**.

![Really complex one](https://zigavaupot.github.io/blogger/talking-to-oracle-database-slovenian/images/select-ai-realy-complex-one-si.png)

### Looking Ahead  

This level of intelligent interpretation is the kind of advancement I hope to see in **future improvements** for Oracle Analytics.

Stay tuned, as I plan to conduct more testsâ€”especially exploring how the AI Assistant performs with subject areas, which are multidimensional by defaultâ€”in the coming days! ðŸš€
