### Itâ€™s Finally Here!

AI Assistant has been available in Oracle Analytics for a few months now, but until recently, I hadnâ€™t been able to test or use it. Why? Because Oracle only enabled its built-in LLM in select regions and on instances with at least 10 OCPUs.

Is that a reasonable limitation? Probably. But for those of us who arenâ€™t spending thousands of Universal Credits on our OAC instances every month, itâ€™s also pretty frustrating. A powerful temptating featureâ€”so close, yet still out of reach.

With the March 2025 release, this is finally changing! Oracle has enhanced the Oracle Analytics AI Assistant by adding the option to use third-party LLMs. And of course, I immediately put it to the test.

### What is Oracle Analytics AI Assistant

Oracle Analytics AI Assistant is a built-in AI-powered feature in **Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)** that helps users interact with their data more intuitively using **natural language**. It leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to assist with data exploration, visualization, and insights generation.  

**Key Capabilities**

- **Conversational Analytics** â€“ Ask questions in natural language and get insights instantly.   
- **Visualization Generation** â€“ Automatically creates charts and dashboards based on queries.  
- **Third-Party LLM Integration (March 2025)** â€“ New capability to use external AI models for enhanced analysis.  

With this feature, Oracle aims to make **self-service analytics more accessible** to both technical and non-technical users by reducing the complexity of working with data.  

### Registering and Activating a 3rd-Party LLM with Oracle Analytics  

To integrate a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) with Oracle Analytics, users need to follow a few key steps. One of the primary steps is registering the LLM within Oracle Analytics.  

A new option, **Large Language Models**, is now available under **Extensions and Enrichments** in the **Console**.  

![Administration Console](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/oac-admin-console.png?raw=true)  

The image below shows an example of a registered LLM named **ChatGPT** (a custom name). This LLM is set as the active model used for the **Assistant** feature. Registering and activating a third-party LLM is a two-step process:  

---

### 1. Register the LLM  

To register an LLM with Oracle Analytics, click **Register LLM to use in Oracle Analytics Features**.  

![Register LLM to use in OA Features](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/register-llm-to-use-in-oa-features.png?raw=true)  

A pop-up window appears with a registration form where detailed information about the model must be entered. Currently, only **OpenAI** can be selected as the *LLM Service*, and **gpt-4-turbo** is the available *Model* option.  

Users must provide an **API Key**, which can be obtained from the [OpenAI API Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).  

When creating a **new secret key**, the **API Key** is generated. Users should copy and store it in a safe location, as it cannot be retrieved later.  

![Create API Key](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/api-keys.png?raw=true)  

After obtaining the API Key, paste it into the designated field in the *Register LLM* form. The API Key must be validated before proceeding.  

In this example, two LLMs have been registered:  

![Registered LLMs list](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/registered-llm-list.png?raw=true)  

The list above shows that the **ChatGPT** model is active (*Status* column), and its **Feature Usage** is set to *Assistant*. The **ChatGPT-4T** model, however, has *None* as its **Feature Usage**, indicating it is not yet activated.

### 2. Activate Analytics Features  

Once an LLM is registered, it must be activated to be used in Oracle Analytics.  

![Activate LLM](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/activate-llm.png?raw=true)  

To activate the model, select it from the **LLM Name** list and confirm by clicking **Update**.  

Once successfully activated, the newly registered model will be ready for use:

### Let's Test It!  

I must admit, I was caught unprepared. To save my credits, I currently have only one **OAC Professional Edition** instance active. While this is perfectly fine and allows me to use ChatGPT, I am unable to test how it interacts with **Subject Areas**. That will have to wait until my new **OAC Enterprise Edition** instance is updated with the March 2025 release.  

For my initial tests, I am using the standard **cloud_sample_data_denorm** dataset, which consists of simple, flattened sales data.  

![Sample dataset](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/cloud-sample-data-denorm.png?raw=true)  

---

## Preparing the Dataset  

Before using the dataset with the AI Assistant, two additional steps are required:  

### 1. Enable Insights  

Open **Inspect** for the dataset and check the **Enable Insights** checkbox under the **General** tab.  

![Enable insights](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/inspect-general-enable-insights.png?raw=true)  

### 2. Index the Dataset  

Navigate to **Search** in the **Inspect** pop-up window and set the parameters that define dataset indexing.  

![Search](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/inspect-search.png?raw=true)  

Before using the dataset with the AI Assistant, it must be indexed. Click **Run now** to start the indexing process, which typically completes in about a minute.  

![Indexing](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/dataset-indexing.png?raw=true)  

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Use *synonyms* to improve model performance and response accuracy.

## Testing the AI Assistant  

Now that the dataset has been indexed, we are ready to create a new workbook and interact with the AI Assistant.  

![Open AI Assistant](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/open-ai-assistant.png?raw=true)  

Click the **light bulb icon** in the top black ribbon to open the **Watchlists/Insights/Assistant** window. Navigate to the **Assistant** tab.  

![Open AI Assistant](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/open-ai-assistant.png?raw=true)  

In the **Ask a question ...** field, users can input queries.  

![Ask a question](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/ask-questions.png?raw=true)  

### Example Questions  

#### **1. Basic Revenue Query**  

**Question:** `What is total revenue?`  

**Response:**  

![Question 1](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-1.png?raw=true)  

The response seems accurate. Now, let's refine the query.  

#### **2. Revenue by Month**  

**Question:** `What is revenue by month?`  

![Question 2](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-2.png?raw=true)  

#### **3. Revenue by Customer Segment**  

Let's take it a step further and break revenue down by customer segments.  

![Question 3](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-3.png?raw=true)  

The AI correctly splits revenue by customer segments, but I was hoping to also include a time-based breakdown. I wasn't very specific in my query, so let's refine it further.  

#### **4. Revenue Breakdown by Time and Customer Segment**  

This is what I had in mind:  

![Question 4](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-4.png?raw=true)  

Now, I can change the chart type to something more visually effective, like a *stacked area* chart.  

![Question 5](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-5.png?raw=true)  

This results in the following visualization:  

![Question 6](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-6.png?raw=true)  

I can now add this visualization to my analysis canvas. Hover over the visualization and click the **+** sign to add it to the canvas.  

![Add to canvas](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/add-to-canvas.png?raw=true)  

Hereâ€™s how it looks on the canvas:

## Summary  

Registering a custom AI Assistant in Oracle Analytics appears to work well. My initial questions were answered quickly and correctly. However, as I started testing more complex queriesâ€”especially those involving additional Oracle Analytics contentâ€”the results were not as impressive.  

That said, **Rome wasnâ€™t built in a day**.  

Interestingly, I tested questions in **Slovenian**, and since I am using ChatGPT, it handled them wellâ€”despite the dataset being **English-only**. So, thatâ€™s a promising sign.  

### Comparing with SELECT AI  

I previously tested **SELECT AI** in Oracle Autonomous Database and was surprised by its ability to interpret questions based on implied measures that werenâ€™t explicitly defined in the dataset.  

For instance, even though **Profit Ratio** wasnâ€™t predefined, **SELECT AI** was able to calculate it. In contrast, Oracle Analytics returned the following:  

![Question 7](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/first-glance-at-oac-ai-assistant/images/question-7.png?raw=true)  

When I asked a complex question in Slovenianâ€”`What is revenue, total costs, profit, profit ratio, fixed costs share, variable costs share by product brand, customer segment, and region for this year?`â€”**SELECT AI** got it **100% correct**.  

![Really complex one](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/talking-to-oracle-database-slovenian/images/select-ai-realy-complex-one-si.png?raw=true)  

### Looking Ahead  

This level of intelligent interpretation is what I hope to see in **future improvements** for Oracle Analytics.  

Stay tuned, as I plan to conduct more tests, for example what happens when using subject area which is multidimensional by default, in the coming days! ðŸš€
