# Introduction

In one of my recent projects, the customer had a requirement to integrate visualizations from Oracle Analytics into Oracle APEX application that is running within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

It is not my prime focus, the integrations, so I checked Oracle's documentation first. There is no "cook book" in there, so I looked it up for some good resources on the internet.  Actually, you can find quite a lot of content out there, from blog posts, articles, even videos, however most of these are a bit old (not exactly obsolete) as both products have developed rapidly over the last couple of years.

But still, I found some really good ones that I was able to help myself with. For example [Mike Durran's blog](https://medium.com/@insight2action) is usually the ultimate go-to source for these kind of things, and you can find quite a lot of content on this subject there. For example, you definitely want to check his article [A Guide to Embedding Oracle Analytics into Oracle APEX](https://medium.com/oracledevs/a-guide-to-embedding-oracle-analytics-into-oracle-application-express-apex-1799f6ba4626).

In this blog post, I will try to describe my experience with integrating Oracle Analytics visualizations into Oracle APEX application, and point out some of the issues I encountered when I was following Mark's guide.
