In one of my recent projects, the customer had a requirement to integrate visualizations from Oracle Analytics into Oracle APEX application that is running within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

It is not my prime focus, the integrations, so I checked Oracle's documentation first. There is no "cook book" in there, so I looked it up for some good resources on the internet.  Actually, you can find quite a lot of content out there, from blog posts, articles, even videos, however most of these are a bit old (not exactly obsolete) as both products have developed rapidly over the last couple of years.

But still, I found some really good ones that I was able to help myself with. For example [Mike Durran's blog](https://medium.com/@insight2action) is usually the ultimate go-to source for these kind of things, and you can find quite a lot of content on this subject there. For example, you definitely want to check his article [A Guide to Embedding Oracle Analytics into Oracle APEX](https://medium.com/oracledevs/a-guide-to-embedding-oracle-analytics-into-oracle-application-express-apex-1799f6ba4626).

In this blog post, I will try to describe my experience with integrating Oracle Analytics visualizations into Oracle APEX application, and point out some of the issues I encountered when I was following Mark's guide.

### Let's begin with Oracle Analytics first

Our starting point is data visualization that shows company's sales.

![CEO Dashboard](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/embed-oac-into-apex/images/ceo-dashboard.png?raw=true)

There is one thing that we should pay attention to. In **Developer options**, besides performance statistics, you can find, under **Embed** tab, developer options that enable developers to embed analytics content in other applications, for example in Oracle APEX.

To embed specific visualization in some other application, developer can simply copy HTML code into another application to display and present Oracle Analytics content.

![HTML Code](https://github.com/zigavaupot/blogger/blob/main/embed-oac-into-apex/images/embed-scripts.png?raw=true)

The following two JavaScript code snippets have to be copied into HTML page at the page level tag:

```htm
<script src="https://<your analytics instance>.analytics.ocp.oraclecloud.com/public/dv/v1/embedding/<embeddingMode>/embedding.js" type="application/javascript">
</script>
```

Pay attention to the *embeddingMode* part of the URL above. It has to possible values: *jet* and *standalone*:

* use *jet* if analytics content is embedded within an existing Oracle JET application, and
* use *standalone* when embedding visualization content in a generic application that doesnâ€™t use Oracle JET.

In the case of *standalone* option, Knockout bindings have to be applied after the visualization is fully loaded. This should be placed inside of a `<script>` tag after the `<oracle-dv>` tag (see below), or executed in an onload body handler.

```htm
<script>
  requirejs(['knockout', 'ojs/ojcore', 'ojs/ojknockout', 'ojs/ojcomposite', 'jet-composites/oracle-dv/loader'],function(ko) {
   ko.applyBindings();
   });
</script>
```

Finally, the following code will be used to display visualization canvas in other application, Oracle APEX application in our case. The following `<oracle-dv>` tag will be used:

```htm
<oracle-dv project-path="/@Catalog/shared/Demos/CEO Dashboard (Sales)" active-page="insight" active-tab-id="snapshot!canvas!1">
</oracle-dv>
```

Example above displays *canvas1*, in the example below, *canvas3* will be displayed.

```htm
<oracle-dv project-path="/@Catalog/shared/Demos/CEO Dashboard (Sales)" active-page="insight" active-tab-id="snapshot!canvas!3">
</oracle-dv>
```

**REMARKS:**

1. To open **Developer Options** click on the Workbook Menu. **Developer** is the last option in the menu:

2. If **Developer** option is not displayed in the menu, than Developer Options is not enabled. To enable them, click on user icon (top right corner) and choose **Profile**.

Then, click on **Advanced** tab and click to **Enable developer options**:
